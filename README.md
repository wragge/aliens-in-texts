# Aliens in texts

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and data I used in preparing for my talk 'Who belongs? Reading identity, ownership, and legitimacy' for the [From text to data â€“ new ways of reading](http://www.delegia.com/app/netattm/attendee/page/81997) conference at the National Library of Sweden.

I was exploring the occurance and contexts of the words 'aliens' and 'immigrants' in Australian newspapers, *The Bulletin*, and Commonwealth Hansard.

This repository includes notebooks copied from my [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.github.io/).
